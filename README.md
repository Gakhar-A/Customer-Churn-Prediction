# Customer-Churn-Prediction

This project focuses on understanding and predicting customer churn in a telecom company using data analysis, visualization, and machine learning. It also includes a dynamic Power BI dashboard for business insights.

--> Project Structure:
Churn Analysis - EDA.ipynb: Exploratory Data Analysis and Machine Learning modeling in Python.
Telco-Customer-Churn.csv: Raw dataset used for analysis.
Telecom-Churn-Analysis-Dashboard.pbix: Interactive Power BI dashboard summarizing churn insights.

--> Problem Statement
Customer churn is a critical issue in the telecom industry. This project aims to:
Understand customer behavior through data analysis.
Identify key factors affecting churn.
Predict churn using machine learning algorithms.
Provide actionable business insights through a dashboard.

--> Exploratory Data Analysis
Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
Univariate & Bivariate Analysis
Correlation & Distribution Plots
